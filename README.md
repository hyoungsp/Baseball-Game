The game, at first, generate three three random numbers (positive integers) from 1 through 9.
An user can guess them with total three trials.

If they guessed all three numbers with a right order, then they obtained 3 Strikes. But, they guessed a right number but
in a different order, then they get a Ball.

For example, the code, in Python, generated three numbers in order, 7, 4, 8, and an user guessed it with a same order
7 - 4 - 8, then he/she gets 3 Strikes. But another user attempts with 6 - 4 - 7, then he/she gets 1 Strike 1 Ball.

Have Fune!
